### Project Overview

You're almost done! Now it's time to build something you're proud to call your own.

This is an open-ended exercise. There is no set solution that we can provide, but of course we are here to help. This is your project!

### Directions
* You're going to be making your own site. This can be a site that you imagine, but feel free to pick an existing website and try to mimic it. Some websites that use React that you can model yours after are:
  - https://www.airbnb.com/
  - https://citymapper.com/boston
  - https://reddit.com
  - https://www.instagram.com/
  - https://www.nytimes.com/

* Once you have a website with basic functionality that you're satisfied with, look at the "Further Directions" section and choose at least one of the options to implement.

* Then, host your app on Heroku.

### Requirements

* Make sure you utilize both nested components and `state`.
* Make sure you use React Router and include a nav bar.
* Use ES6 syntax; don't forget about functional components!
* We don't have a database set up, so if you need data, feel free to hard-code a little (just enough to get the idea) or use `fetch` to call an API.

### Suggestions and Hints

- Don't worry about styling at first! Focus on getting the functionality working.
- Remember that `state` and `props` are **not** the same!
  - Remember that `state` represents the _state_ of your user interface component.
  - `state` can trigger changes in `props`, or `props` can come from parent components.
- Stick to functional programming techniques whenever possible. By this, we mean use built-in methods such as `.forEach()` and `.map()` if available.
- If you are rendering a list of child components (such as a _ul_ -> _li_ list), each individual child component needs a unique `id` for React to work with it. This is so React can identify each element uniquely, if necessary.

### Further Directions

Once you have a website with basic functionality that you're satisfied with, choose at least one of the below options to implement.

* **Option 1:** Learn about React styling. Strengthen your knowledge of React by creating a new React application and recreating the UI, or by applying styling to the project you started in the last exercise.
* **Option 2:** Learn about and implement React animations and apply them to the blog or the project you built in the last exercise.
* **Option 3:** In addition to animations, incorporate Flow — a static type checker — into your application.

### Deliverables

When you're satisfied with your web application and have implemented at least one of the further options, host your app on Heroku. Share the link as well as your repository with your instructor.
